### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm James, a software developer passionate about learning new languages and skills to use in projects. I'm currently undertaking a software engineering bootcamp with HyperionDev, working on Python, HTML, CSS, Django and SQL.

A future ambition of mine is to work on a chess engine as a fun way to learn a new language.
