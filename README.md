### Projects
These are a few of my favourite projects that I've developed/am developing. For a full list of my projects, please visit my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/sben0379?tab=repositories).
* [Project Manager](https://github.com/sben0379/ProjectManager): The latest version of the first major capstone project I worked on. It is designed to read and write to external files in order to monitor team project progress and calculate and display useful statistics. 
* [Eddie](https://github.com/sben0379/Eddie): A long term project to create a 2000 ELO strength chess engine using Python. I plan to keep a blog as I work on the project. 
* [Inventory Manager](https://github.com/sben0379/InventoryManager): The first capstone project I've written that makes use of OOP. It creates objects when reading from an external file (in this case shoes) and allows them to be accessed via their attributes and be manipulated accordingly. 
* [Minesweeper](https://github.com/sben0379/Minesweeper): A simple programme demonstrating the use of multi-dimensional lists. The programme generates a random minefield and detects how many mines are adjacent to each square on the grid, displaying the number accordingly.
